#### Why do I need to do work before the semester? It's break!
Generally speaking, the data structures and algorithms course is one of the toughest for CS majors (across universities, not just at URI). This course should put together your problem solving and programming skills and push you to think beyond short and disjointed code-- enabling you to think through and solve large-scale and real-world problems.

Because the topics we're going to cover are already challenging in it of themselves, it's important you come in as prepared as possible so you don't have to play catch up while learning new material.

#### Okay fine, but do I **have** to?
Reviewing the material below before the start of the semester is **strongly recommended for all** students *especially* if:
- You didn't do too hot on 211
- This is your first C++ course 
- Pointers aren't your strong suit
- Object oriented programming is still confusing
- You haven't taken or will be concurrently taking MTH 180 

#### Alright, fine, where do I start?
