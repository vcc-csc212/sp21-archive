#### Motivation (Why are we doing this?) {#motivation}
The goal of this deep dive is to provide some insight into **advanced recursive algorithms**. Being comfortable with reading, writing, and analyzing recursive algorithms is crucial for understanding all our upcoming topics.

#### Background Info {#bgi}

Fractals are geometric figures in which each part has the same statistical character as the entire figure. In other words, the same patterns repeated at varying scales. Here are a few! **Can you find the repeating patterns in each of these fractals?**


##### Sierpinski Carpet

> **Sierpinski Carpet:** A square with 8 smaller squares one-third its size placed around it.

##### Sierpinski Triangle

> **Sierpinski Triangle:** An equilateral triangle subdivided into 4 smaller equilateral triangles, with the inner triangle removed.

<br>

##### Koch Snowflake

> **Koch Snowflake:** An equilateral triangle where each edge gets a triangle placed one-third the size of the original, and has its base removed.

<br>

Now that we understand the pattern, we need to learn how to implement them! To this effect, we will be utilizing 'L-systems'.

---

##### Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems)

An 'L-system' is an alphabet of symbols that form strings, which represent a collection of production rules. In this case, we will be the following 'L-system':

F : Move forward

\- : Turn left by some degree

\+ : Turn right by some degree

So, a valid string for this system could be 

> Draw out the shape generated by the following strings using our system:
1. "F + F + F + F", run with a turn degree of 90
2. "F - F - F", run with a turn degree of 60

---

#### Your Task {#task}

You will implement two of the fractal shapes above by utilizing an 'L-system'. Your task is to create **recursive functions** that generate the string necessary to draw the shape, for a Sierpinski Triangle and a Koch Snowflake. You have been supplied with some skeleton code to get you started, as well as a python script to convert a generated string into a .png image representation.

Here are some animations to help you in determining the rules for your strings:

##### Sierpinski Triangle

##### Koch Snowflake

![image](/labs/lab-06/images/koch-snowflake-3.mp4)

To understand how the Koch Snowflake is drawn, these images show the completion of the image at the 3 loop iterations in the ```koch_snowflake``` function.

After the first iteration:

After the second iteration:

After the third iteration:

<center><img src="/labs/lab-06/images/koch-snowflake-3 (3-3 iterations).png"/></center>

##### Notes

- To use the python file: `python3 l-system-plotter.py l-system.txt <output file name> <degree for turns>  `
  - degree should be 60 for both of these problems!
- Get a feeling for the string you should be generating BEFORE you start coding.
- Utilize [this website](https://trinket.io/python/ac4e46dc05) to see your L-System drawn slowly.
- You may code your solutions on [this repl.it page](https://repl.it/@ChristianEsteve/CSC212-Lab-6).
