It's never too early to start thinking about a final project! Final projects are a completely open-ended opportunity for you to demonstrate your deepest understanding of whatever topics you'd like. Final projects are **due Thursday, May 6th @ 3:30pm** (two weeks after classes end). 

**If you're paying attention**, you'll notice that final projects are due on the same day of your final exam AND that the times coincide. Your final exam slot time starts at 3:00pm on the same day--  we'll use the first 25 minutes to answer any last minute questions. You'll then submit your final project if you haven't already, take a 5 min breather, and begin your final exam.

#### Notes on Final Exam 
- Unlike traditional exams, the final exam **can only improve (not hurt) your course grade**.
- It'll be cumulative, with a stronger focus on material from week 8 and forward (since the idterm covers weeks 1-7).

#### Notes on Final Project 
- You may work individually or in groups of up to 4.
- The more people in the group, the higher the expectations for the final product. 
- Technically, the final project is optional
- Doing a final project is **the only way to get an A (or a B** if you missed other assignments)

#### Final Project Requirements

Scope
: Scope of project must be significantly broader than that of an assigned lab or deep dive.

Code Compilation
: Must compile and execute without any warning or errors.

Code Execution
: Program must execute completely without crashing.

Modular/OOP
: Functions and classes must be used appropriately to abstract and divvy-up your code (i.e., must follow OOP principles)

Concepts
: Should demonstrate a clear ` mastery ` of chosen topics.

README
: Project should include a README.txt (or README.md) that answers:
- **Purpose overview:** What’s the purpose/use case of this project?
- **Instructions for use:** Describe how the user will interact with your program (is there anything the user shouldn’t do? Tell us!)
- **Design overview:** How did you choose to represent the aspects of your program (i.e., what data structures did you choose and why)?
- **Code overview:** An overview of how your program works, including how all of the pieces fit together
- **Potential bugs:** A description of any possible bugs or problems with your program
- **Easter Eggs:** A description of any extra features you chose to implement, if any
- **Group:** The names of all group members
- **Topic Overview:** What topics does your final project demonstrate `mastery` in and how?
