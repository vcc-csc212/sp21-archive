#### What assignments can I resubmit?
You may resubmit **deep dives** and **labs** only.

#### How do I resubmit?
For Labs
: If you did not fully or correctly complete your lab assignment during your lab section, you may get it checked off during hours. If you missed your scheduled lab section, you cannot make up that assignment.

For Deep Dives
: If you did not fully or correctly complete your deep dive assignment by the due date, you may submit a "Regrade Request" through Gradescope. If you missed the deadline for a deep dive, you cannot make up that assignment. To submit a regrade request you must answer:
1. How you identified your mistakes (how did you know where it was)
2. How you fixed your mistakes (what did you change and **why**)

#### What's the deadline for resubmitting?
You have until **Thursday, April 29th @ 3:30pm** (one week after classes end) to resubmit any deep dive or lab.
