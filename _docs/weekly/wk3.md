#### Pre-Reading for  Basic Sorting Algos (Analysis), Tuesday 2/9 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What is the time complexity of selection sort and why?  
✔️ What is the time complexity of bubble sort and why?  
✔️ What is the time complexity of insertion sort and why?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
> Order is important for the material below-- especially the videos. Lalitha's videos show you how to analyze the algorithms in the way we're used to-- by explicitly counting primitive operations, whereas 
Back To Back SWE's videos show you how to do it at a more abstract level, which is where we're headed for future analyses. 

Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Selection Sort Algorithm](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/selection-sorting)
	- If you're comfortable with how the algorithm works and is implemented, you can scroll halfway down and only read *Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort*
- Watch [Selection Sort - Time Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhNlp_q7mQk) (Lalitha, 11 min)
- Read [Bubble Sort Algorithm](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/bubble-sort)
	- If you're comfortable with how the algorithm works and is implemented, you can scroll halfway down and only read *Optimized Bubble Sort Algorithm* and *Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort*
- Watch [Bubble Sort - Time Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yffvd3pkTW4) (Lalitha, 11 min)
- Watch [An In-Depth Algorithmic Analysis of Bubble Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euPlXW7dnlI) (Back to Back SWE, 29 min)
	- Keep in mind that the *Best Case* analysis assumes using the **optimized** version of Bubble Sort, where if you don't swap for an entire iteration then you stop altogether because the array is sorted.
- Read [Insertion Sort Algorithm](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/insertion-sorting)
	- If you're comfortable with how the algorithm works and is implemented, you can scroll halfway down and only read *Complexity Analysis of Insertion Sort*
- Watch [Insertion Sort - Time Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6jppwMbB0k) (Lalitha, 13 min)
- Watch [A Detailed Algorithmic Analysis of Insertion Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufIET8dMnus) (Back to Back SWE, 37 min)


##### In Class
In today's class we'll be doing a brief review of the time complexity for the sorting algorithms above and the rest of the time will be for you to start working on Deep Dive 2.

#### Pre-Reading for Dynamic Arrays (Implementation), Thursday 2/11 {#thurs}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does a dynamic array work?  
✔️ What're the pros and cons of using dynamic vs static arrays?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read the [Lab 3 Handout](/sp21-archive/lab03)
	- If you'd like an additional written explainer on dynamic arrays, read [Dynamic Array Data Structure](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/cpp/dynamic-array)
- Watch [The Simple and Elegant Idea behind Efficient Dynamic Arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij7NQ-0mIVA) (8 min)
	- He refers to a "previous video" which is [What if you had to invent a dynamic array?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AllG-i_yto) (14 min)-- this "previous video" isn't required but it's strongly recommended if you're confused by the starting point in the assigned video.
- Watch [Dynamic array and Static array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9mGE6-svxg) (12 min)
	- The code example is in JavaScript but the description applies to C++ as well.

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be continuing to work on our lab's dynamic array implementation.
