#### Pre-Reading for Heapsort & Intro to Graphs, Tuesday 4/13 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does the heapsort algorithm work?  
✔️ What is heapsort's time complexity and why?  
✔️ What is a graph and what purpose does it serve?  
✔️ What are the various types of graphs and some of their uses/applications?  
✔️ What are some ways to represent graphs in code?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Heap Sort Algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort)
	- This article also reviews heaps and their array-version implementation. If you are comfortable with your understanding of heaps, scroll down about half-way to "How Heap Sort Works?"
- Watch [Heap sort in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DmK_H7IdTo) (4 min)
- Read [Don’t Understand Graphs? Here’s Why You Should Study Graphs in Computer Science](https://bennettgarner.medium.com/what-the-graph-a-beginners-simple-intro-to-graphs-in-computer-science-3808d542a0e5)
- Read [Introduction to Graphs](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paton/readings/Old/fall08/GRAPH.html)
- Watch [Introduction to Graph Theory: A Computer Science Perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFKZLXVO-Dg) (16 min)

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be reviewing heapsort and introductory graph concepts.
