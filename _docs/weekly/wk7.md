#### Pre-Reading for Quicksort, Tuesday 3/9 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does the quicksort algorithm work?  
✔️ What's the time complexity of quicksort algorithm?    

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Quick Sort Algorithm](https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/quicksort-algorithm/)
- Watch [Quick Sort, GeeksforGeeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgBzjlCcFvc) (3 min)
- Watch [Algorithms: Quick Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLauY6PpjW4) (9 min)
	- Note that the implementation is in Java but the implementation in C++ would be very similar.
- Read [Analysis of Quick Sort](https://www.educative.io/courses/visual-introduction-to-algorithms/mkM8E)
- Watch [The Quicksort Sorting Algorithm: Pick A Pivot, Partition, & Recurse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXBnyYuwPe8) (26 min)
	- Time complexity explanation starts @ 15 min mark

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be debugging broken implementations of quicksort.
