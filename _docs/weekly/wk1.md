##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below. If your math is rough around the edges, I recommend checking out the [Math Prep Work](/sp21-archive/prep#math) posted over break **before** completing the material below.
- Read [Rules of Exponents](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/intermediate-algebra/rules-of-exponents/)
	- Alternatively, for a one-stop shop of Exponents and Logarithms, read [Exponentials: Discrete, Real, and Imaginary](https://sites.google.com/site/butwhymath/algebra/eponentials-discrete-real-and-imaginary)
- Read [Logarithms Explained](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/advanced-algebra/logarithms-explained/)
- Read [Rules or Laws of Logarithms](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/advanced-algebra/logarithm-rules/)
- Read/Watch [Permutations and Combinations](https://www.mathplanet.com/education/algebra-2/discrete-mathematics-and-probability/permutations-and-combinations)
- Read [Using Summation Notation](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-collegealgebra/chapter/using-summation-notation/)
- Read [Summation Notation](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SummationNotation.aspx)(pay close attention to the **formulas**)
- Read/Watch [Simplifying Factorials: The Easy Way](https://medium.com/i-math/simplifying-factorials-the-easy-way-61c221c21b57)

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be doing going over some of the properties you learned about in the readings, relating them to our next topic of *analysis of algorithms*, and practicing getting comfortable with all the math symbols and jargon we'll be seeing the rest of the semester.
