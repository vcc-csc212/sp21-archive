#### Pre-Reading for Intro to Analysis of Algos, Tuesday 2/2 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ Why is time complexity important?  
✔️ What are common order-of-growth classifications?
✔️ What are the differences between Big-O, Big-Omega, and Theta?  
✔️ What is the process for analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Gaddis 9.6: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms](/files/Gaddis-Algos.pdf)
- Watch [Analyzing Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gN6KCS_D4k) (15 min)
- Watch [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yo7Kxa0vOU) (14 min)
- Explore [Common Complexities, Graphed](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pdft1nieox)
	- When I say explore, I mean zoom in and out, add constants, compare values at small vs large x values, etc.
- Read [Asymptotic Notations](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/aysmptotic-notations)
- Watch [Asymptotic Bounding 101: Big O, Big Omega, & Theta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oDAlMwTrLo) (23 min)


##### In Class
In today's class we'll be analyzing and comparing the time complexity of simple algorithms. We'll also talk briefly about why we can't just manually time algorithms, and why asymptotic analysis is important.

#### Pre-Reading for Basic Sorting Algos (Implementation), Thursday 2/4 {#thurs}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What's the difference between stable and unstable sorting and why does it matter?  
✔️ How does bubble sort work?  
✔️ How does selection sort work?  
✔️ How does insertion sort work?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Stable Sorting Algorithms](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/stable-sorting-algorithms)
	- You can ignore section 3.3 "Radix Sort"
- Watch [Stable Sort vs Unstable Sort Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akLN-F0HSS4) (4 min)
- Read [The Bubble Sort](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/TheBubbleSort.html)
	- You can ignore the runtime analysis for now (after the animation)
- Watch [Introduction to Bubble Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6m-g0SPzt0) (8 min)
- Watch [Bubble Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmhjrI-aW5o) (1 min)
- Read [The Selection Sort](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/TheSelectionSort.html)
	- You can ignore the runtime analysis for now (after the animation)
	- **Note:** The reading has you find the **largest** element each time whereas the videos have you find the **smallest** element-- either approach is fine.
- Watch [Introduction to Selection Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3dCjzhjAWA) (11 min)
- Watch [Selection Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWBP4lzkoyM) (2 min)
- Read [The Insertion Sort](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/TheInsertionSort.html)
- Watch [Introduction to Insertion Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJsmUw3-QRA) (13 min)
- Watch [Insertion Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGzPmgsI-pQ) (2 min)

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be debugging implementations of basic sorting algorithms.
