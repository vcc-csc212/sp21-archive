There are 6 types of assignments that will allow you to demonstrate your knowledge on the topics in the course. Each assignment will have clear grading guidelines to allow you to determine what constitutes achiveing a certain level of [knowledge demonstration](/grading#knowledge-levels) (awareness/understanding/competence/mastery):

> FYI: At the beginning of class you'll be put into small '**study groups**'. These groups will be the ones you work with during class breakout sessions for the duration of the semester, though you're welcome and encouraged to work with them outside of class as well.

SME Presentations
: Subject Matter Expert Presentations **done in class**.
- Create a presentation on the topic for the day and present it to your study group during class. 
- Your presentation should be no more than 10 minutes, should answers that unit's essential questions, and include relevant code or analysis examples.
- You may work on this presentation by yourself or with one other person from your study group.
- A copy of your presentation should be **submitted in class**.

Wet toes
: Short practice problems to be completed and **submitted in class**.

Labs
: Medium practice problems to be completed and **checked off during your lab section**.

Deep dives
: Medium and longer practice problems to be **completed outside of class** and submitted by the deadline.
- Deep dive assignments are be released on Monday mornings and are be **due by the following Thursday at 3:30pm** (by the start of class the week after it was released).

Exams
: There are two exams (a midterm and a final) for the course but unlike traditional exams, **they can only improve (not hurt) your course grade**.
- The midterm will be taken **during class** 
- The final will be taken at our **scheduled final exam time**

Final Project
: Final projects are a completely open-ended opportunity for you to demonstrate your deepest understanding of whatever topics you'd like. Final projects are **due Thursday, May 6th @ 3:30pm** (two weeks after classes end).
- You may work individually or in groups of up to 4.
- The more people in the group, the higher the expectations for the final product.
