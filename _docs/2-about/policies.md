#### Expectations {#expectations}
> **TLDR:** Be a responsible adult and a good human being.

##### What you should expect from me
- To foster a welcoming, inclusive, supportive, and empowering space for all.
- To welcome and ask for feedback and constructive criticism.
- To (re)act to improve based on feedback and constructive criticism received.
- To make assignment expectations and grading guidelines available before assignments are due.

##### What I expect from you
- To understand that your learning and that of your peers’ relies on your understanding of the material and your ability to exchange ideas in class and online.
- To come prepared for class. That means you should have read and/or watched the material posted online **before** coming to class.
- To participate in class. Ask questions, share concerns and resources. 
- To hold yourself accountable and manage your time wisely. 
- To have high expectations of yourself and your work.
- To collaborate well with others in both small and large groups.

#### Late Policy {#late}
> **TLDR:** No late work. Manage your time wisely and submit what you can.

No late work will be accepted. You have multiple opportunities to demonstrate your knowldege of any given topic, including through the final project. If you're running tight on time, submit a partial solution so you can [resubmit later](/resubmissions).

#### Collaboration and Academic Honesty {#integrity}
Collaborating is key to succeeding in this course. Helping others will allow you to gauge and improve your own understanding, while asking for help will allow you to move forward without feeling overwhelmed or being stuck for too long. 

##### The following is allowed:
> **TLDR:** Read this policy before you end up in the Dean's office.

- You may work with others on all assignments **except exams**, but each person must hand in their own **significantly distinct** solution. 
	- You must mention, somewhere on your assignment, who you worked with and how your solutions are significantly distinct.
- You may ask for help and may help others with debugging. 
	- You must mention, somewhere on your assignment, who helped you and with what.
- You may, and are encouraged to, seek help online/in books. 
	- You must mention, somewhere on your assignment, the sources you used and for what.

##### The following is NOT allowed:
- You may not share your own code with peers (current or future students of the course).
- You may not copy code from peers (current or past students of the course).
- You may not copy code from online (or other) resources.

#### Accommodations {#accommodations}
> **TLDR:** Let me know ASAP how to best support you and ensure your success in the course.

I am working very hard to ensure my course is as accessible as possible. That being said, if you need any accommodations, please contact me as soon as possible so that we may work together to support your success in this course. While I do not require students to have a documented disability to receive accommodations in my course, most courses do and as such, I encourage you to contact Disability Services for Students (Office of Student Life, 330 Memorial Union, 401-874-2098).

#### Academic Support Services {#support}
> **TLDR:** Use all the resources available to you.

URI offers an array of resources to enable you to succeed in all your courses. While I recommend you first contact me or our TAs and come to our hours, the University offers a variety of services through the Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) and Writing Center (WC). For information on any of their programs, visit [uri.edu/aec](https://uri.edu/aec) or call the AEC’s main number at 401-874-2367. 

#### Anti-Bias {#abt}
> **TLDR:** There's zero tolerance in my class for any kind of [-ism](https://www.thoughtco.com/types-of-oppression-721173). Know better, do better, be better.

We, as a class and community, respect the rights and dignity of each individual and group. We reject prejudice and intolerance, and we work to understand differences. We believe that equity and inclusion are critical components for campus community members to thrive. If you are a target or a witness of a bias incident, you are encouraged to submit a report to the URI Bias Response Team at uri.edu/brt. There, you will also find people and resources to help. 

#### Covid Safety {#covid}
> **TLDR:** We're in the middle of a very real pandemic. Don't be foolish.

As members of the URI community, students are required to comply with standards of conduct and take precautions to keep themselves and others safe. Students are required to comply with Rhode Island state laws, including the Rhode Island Executive Orders related to health and safety, ordinances, regulations, and guidance adopted by the University as it relates to public health crises, such as COVID-19.  You are expected to know and comply with these obligations, including but not limited to:
- Wearing of face masks by all community members when on a URI campus in the presence of others
- Maintaining physical distancing of at least six feet at all times
- Following state rules on the number of individuals allowed in a group gathering
- Completing a daily health self-assessment also available through the Rhody Connect app before coming to campus
- Submitting to COVID-19 testing as the University monitors the health of our community
Following the University’s quarantine and isolation requirements
 
If you are already on campus and start to feel ill, you need to remove yourself from the public and notify URI Health Services via phone immediately at 401-874-2246 and go home/back to your room and self-isolate while you await direction from Health Services.
