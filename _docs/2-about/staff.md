#### About your instructor {#vcc}
My name is Victoria C. Chávez (they/she) and I’m excited to be your instructor for this course! You may call me Victoria or Professor Chávez, whichever you prefer. I am excited to get to meet you all and I'm looking forward to this semester!

![cropped headshot of Prof. Chávez](/sp21-archive/2-about/imgs/vcc.jpg)
: I was born and raised in Chicago, I’m Guatemalan, and I now call Rhode Island home. I have a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and a Master’s focusing on Computer Science Education. I’ve worked as a Software Engineer at Twitter and Microsoft, and I’ve taught middle, high school, and college level Computer Science courses. This is my fourth semester at URI and my second as a Lecturer (full-time faculty).

**A note on pronounciation:** The correct way to say last name is with a **hard "ch"** (like in "chimichanga") and with **emphasis on the "a"** not "vez".

#### About your TAs {#tas}
<br><br>Alexander:
: I'm a Computer Science undergrad and am minoring in both Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity here at URI. Outside of programming for my internship and class, one of my favorite pastimes is reading a good book.
<br><br>
**You'll see me:** At hours on Wednesdays and Fridays, and on Piazza!

: I’m a Computer Science PhD candidate here at URI. From MA, I earned my BS & MS in Computer Science from UMASS Dartmouth. Most of my free time is spent playing video games, with the occasional adventures to places like Zion National Park, and Antelope Canyon.
<br><br>
**You'll see me:** In class, in lab and at hours on Thursdays

<br><br>
**You'll see me:** In lab 2 and at hours on Mondays and Fridays. Feel free to stop by during hours to ask any questions you may have or just say "hi". I am looking forward to meeting everyone!

![cropped headshot of Zach](/sp21-archive/2-about/imgs/zach.jpg) 
: **Zach**: I am from Hershey, Pennsylvania. I am currently finishing my last semester of senior year majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security. This year I am a captain of the URI Mens Club Lacrosse team and once I graduate in the spring I will be moving to North Carolina to work as a software engineer for Fidelity Investments. Besides school some of my interests include snowboarding, reading, and calligraphy.

**You'll see me:** At hours. Feel free to utilize my student hours if you need anything or have questions. I'm always happy to help!

#### Hours {#hours}
Student hours (also called help hours, office hours, or simply hours for short) are an opportunity for you to **engage with your professors and TAs outside of course meeting times**. They're a place where you can **receive support, resources, and chat about the course, department, or major**. 

> Go often, even when you don’t think or feel you need to.

All hours will be held **virtually** this semester. For join info see the [schedule](#sched).

##### Going to TAs' Hours
TAs are a wonderful resource and support system-- use them often and wisely. TAs are not your instructor so if you haven't attended class or done the readings, don't expect them to teach you the material. There are three main uses of attending TA hours:

While working:
: You can hop into hours *just in case* and do your work during that time so that if a question pops up you can ask.

With a question:
: Your question must be clear and specific-- for example, saying "I need help" is not a question, instead say "What is part 4 is asking me to do?" or "I'm getting a seg fault in this function. I've narrowed it down to these three lines of code."

When stuck:
: Tell us what you are confused about and what you've tried. Don't know where to start? Tell us what you've brainstormed. Code isn't working? Tell us what you've done to debug.

##### Going to Your Professor's Hours
You can ask questions about the course material and assignments, but you can also engage in informal conversations with your professors to help establish a connection-- which will help you should you need references or recommendations for jobs or school! 

Never been to a professor's hours before? When attending hours with professors, make sure to **first introduce yourself and say what class you're in**-- most of us teach multiple courses! You can stop by to simply introduce yourself without staying long or you can stay and chat. Here's a list of things **all professors are happy to talk about**:

✔️ Course material  
✔️ Assignments  
✔️ Career  
✔️ Research  
✔️ College  
✔️ Other course suggestions  
✔️ Suggestions for additional learning (i.e., things you can do outside the classroom)  

Here are some things I personally enjoy talking about:

✔️ Life  
✔️ Existential crises  
✔️ Dogs & Pets (show me your pets!)
