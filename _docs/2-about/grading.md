#### How will I be graded? {#style} 
Instead of the usual point-based or weighted grading system, we'll be using [mastery-based](https://hapara.com/blog/mastery-based-grading/) grading to assess your learning. Mastery-based grading means that:
- As a student, you have **full autonomy** on *how well you do* in the course
- As a student, you have **full autonomy** of *the type of work* you complete (how you demonstrate your knowledge)
- As a student, you get **multiple opportunities** to demonstrate your knowledge

Furthermore, we'll be using an **autograder** to assess a lot of your submissions for correctness, which means you can **submit multiple times and get immediate feedback** so you know whether something's not working.

#### How do I take the most advantage of this grading scheme? {#success}
While confusing at first, you'll see that this approach has several benefits (outlined above). However, this grading scheme will only benefit you if you understand how to take advantage of all the opportunities it provides you. More specifically, that means:
- **Start early and submit often**
	- The autograder gives you immediate feedback to let you know whether functionality is incorrect in your code. Use this to find mistake early!
	> **TLDR**: Start early and submit often.
- **Keep track of your progress to determine what work you need to prioritize and what you can put on the back-burner**
	- With this grading scheme, you don't necessarily need to complete *every* assignment in order to get an A or to pass. However, you do need to keep track of your progress with the [**non-negotiables**](/sp21-archive/outcomes-skills) to ensure you pass the class.
	> **TLDR**: You can skip some assignments and still get an A, BUT if you skip the wrong assignments you won't pass.
- **Resubmit**
	- While we cover several topics over the span of a week, it is not expected that you'll fully understand all of them by the end of that week. A lot of us need more time and practice with any given concept before it 'clicks' and we get it. That being said, it's only fair to actually give you the opportunity to revisit your work and show me you've learned more since we last talked about it in class. 
	> **TLDR**: You're allowed (and encouraged!) to [resubmit assignments](/sp21-archive/resubmissions).

#### What do grades look like? {#grades}
As has been previously mentioned, there are 20 umbrella topics we'll be covering, of which **13 are non-negotiable**. Your grade for the course will be based on your demonstrated knowledge of the non-negotiable topics.

##### To receive a D you must:
- Demonstrate `understanding` in ALL the non-negotiable topics

##### To receive a C you must:
- Demonstrate `understanding` in ALL the non-negotiable topics
- Demonstrate `competence` in AT LEAST 6 of the non-negotiable topics

##### To receive a B you must:
- Option 1:
	- Demonstrate `competence` in ALL of the non-negotiable topics 
- Option 2:
	- Demonstrate `understanding` in ALL the non-negotiable topics
	- Demonstrate `competence` in AT LEAST 6 of the non-negotiable topics 
	- Demonstrate `mastery` in AT LEAST 2 of the non-negotiable topics

##### To receive an A you must:
- Option 1:
	- Demonstrate `competence` in ALL the non-negotiable topics 
	- Demonstrate `mastery` in AT LEAST 3 of the non-negotiable topics
- Option 2:
	- Demonstrate `understanding` in ALL the non-negotiable topics
	- Demonstrate `competence` in AT LEAST 9 of the non-negotiable topics 
	- Demonstrate `mastery` in AT LEAST 5 of the non-negotiable topics

If you'd like to receive a + designation (B+/C+/D+) you'll also have to demonstrate some knowledge on the other topics we'll be covering.

#### To receive a + designation:
- Option 1:
	- Demonstrate `awareness` in all 20 topics
- Option 2:
	- Demonstrate `mastery` in at least 5 topics (any)

#### How do I demonstrate my knowledge? {#knowledge-levels}
There are [6 types of assignments](/sp21-archive/types-assignments) that will allow you to demonstrate your knowledge on all 20 umbrella topics. Here's an outline of the various ways to demonstrate your level of knowledge (awareness/understanding/competence/mastery):

- `Awareness` can be demonstrated via: 
	- SME Presentations
	- Exams (multiple choice and ranking questions)
- `Understanding` can be demonstrated via: 
	- Wet toes
	- Labs
	- Exams (written responses)
	- Deep dives
- `Competence` can be demonstrated via: 
	- Deep dives
	- Labs
- `Mastery` can be demonstrated via: 
	- Final Project

> Please note the following:
- Demonstrating a higher level of knowledge on a topic automatically demonstrates the previous levels (i.e., if you demonstrate `understanding`, you also demonstrate `awareness`)
- Technically, the final project is optional
- However, doing a final project is the only way to get an A (or a B if you missed other assignments)
- In theory, you *could* pass the course by only doing a massive final project that covers all 13 non-negotiables perfectly (not recommended)
