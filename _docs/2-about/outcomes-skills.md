Data structures and algorithms is arguably **the most important course you'll take** in Computer Science. From [getting internships and job offers](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) to [preparing for advanced courses](https://www.synergisticit.com/how-data-structures-and-algorithms-are-important-for-computer-science-graduates/), understanding data structures and algorithms is what differentiates programmers and coders from computer scientists and engineers.

#### What will I learn in this course?
Upon successful completion of the course, you should be able to:
- Implement code using pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Implement solutions that involve recursive functions
- Implement sorting algorithms and understand their performance under different scenarios
- Implement and use basic algorithms, data structures, and containers
- Implement algorithmic solutions using the appropriate data structures and algorithms 
- Compare different algorithms and data structures based on efficiency, using empirical and theoretical algorithm analysis techniques

#### What're the non-negotiables?
Each time we meet for lab or lecture, you'll be learning a new topic. **We move incredibly fast so don't fall behind**. Of all the topics we'll be covering, some of them will be review or preliminary knowledge required for understanding future topics. Taking that into account, the **new topics** we'll be covering can be categorized into **20 umbrella topics** (outlined below):

1. `Intro to Analysis of Algos`
2. `Sorting Algos (Implementation & Analysis)`
3. `Dynamic Arrays`
4. `Linked Lists`
5. `Stacks`
6. `Queues`
7.  Recursive Algorithms
8. Analyzing Recursive Functions (w/ recurrences) 
9. Recursive Backtracking 
10. `Priority Queues`
11. `Heaps`
12. Heapsort 
13. `Binary Search`
14. `BSTs (Implementation & Analysis)`
15. `Balanced Trees`
16. `Sets & Maps`
17. Hashtables 
18. Chaining & Open-Addressing 
19. Intro to Graphs 
20. `BFS & DFS`

Of these 20, the`formatted`**13 are non-negotiable** which means that in order to pass the course, you **must** demonstrate at a minimum, a [level of understanding](/sp21-archive/grading#grades) about them.
